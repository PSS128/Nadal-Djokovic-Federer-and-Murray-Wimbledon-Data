## Measuring Nadal's perfomance at Wimbledon through statistics

- This project attempts to determine Nadal’s strength at Wimbledon over the course of his career (Until 2019)
- I used ggplot in R with publicly available tennis data to create two scatterplot models. 
- The data shows that in recent years, Nadal has become more dominant at Wimbledon, where **dominance is defined to be the “ease” in which one wins a match** 
- From the data, we can conclude that Nadal’s rise in dominance stems from the improvements in his serve.

## Introduction

- I wanted to find a way to quantify Nadal's performance at Wimbledon through his wins and losses, so we can have a better understanding of his actual level
- Nadal has historically had struggles on grass, the surface at Wimbledon, due to grass's property of nullifying the spin of the ball, which is Nadal’s greatest strength
- The playstyles of Djokovic and Federer, on the other hand, are more suited for grass, and they have won Wimbledon more times than Nadal
- Nadal’s playstyle therefore factors into his level of dominance in all of his matches at Wimbledon, which is what this project investigates
