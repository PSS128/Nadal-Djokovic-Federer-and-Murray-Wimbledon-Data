## Measuring Nadal's perfomance at Wimbledon through statistics
R code of Nadal's,Djokovic's, Federer's and Murray's performance at Wimbledon over time

- This study explores a possible method that could be used to determine the greatest tennis player of all time through dominance at a particular tournament. We want to be able to determine Nadal’s strength at Wimbledon over time. 
- I used ggplot in R with publicly available tennis data to create two scatterplot models that measure Nadal’s performance at Wimbledon throughout his current career. The data shows that in recent years, Nadal has become more dominant at Wimbledon, where dominance is defined to be the “ease” in which one wins a match. From the data, we can conclude that Nadal’s rise in dominance stems from the improvements in his serve.
