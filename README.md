## Measuring Nadal's perfomance at Wimbledon through statistics

- This project attempts to determine Nadal’s strength at Wimbledon over the course of his career (Until 2019)
- I used ggplot in R with publicly available tennis data to create two scatterplot models. 
- The data shows that in recent years, Nadal has become more dominant at Wimbledon, where ##dominance is defined to be the “ease” in which one wins a match## 
- From the data, we can conclude that Nadal’s rise in dominance stems from the improvements in his serve.
